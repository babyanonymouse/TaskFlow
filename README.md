# User Authentication and Task Management System

## How It Works

1. **Choose an Action**  
   Type the action you want to perform:
    - **`register`**: Calls the `register_user()` function to create a new user account.
    - **`login`**: Calls the `login_user()` function to access your account and manage tasks.
    - **`exit`**: Exits the program using the `exit()` function.

2. **Features**
    - **User Registration**: Securely create a new account with a unique username and password.
    - **User Login**: Log in to access personalized task management features.
    - **Task Management** *(Available after login)*:
        - Add, view, update, delete, or filter tasks.
        - Organize tasks by priority, status, or deadlines.
